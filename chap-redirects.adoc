= Redirects
Redirects offer you a way to specify one or more request paths that should be redirected to another path or an external url.
A redirect has a destination URL and one ore more paths that should redirect to the destination.
A specific HTTP status code can be configured for every path.

In the domain model, a redirect is implemented as `WebCmsRemoteEndpoint`.
The different paths are the `WebCmsUrl` members of the endpoint (property `urls`).
