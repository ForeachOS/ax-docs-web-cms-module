= Asset model

{module-name} provides a basic model for mapping assets and types.
Example assets provided by default are `WebCmsArticle` and `WebCmsPage`.
Related types would be `WebCmsArticleType` and `WebCmsPageType`.

== WebCmsObject

Both types and assets are implementations of `WebCmsObject`.
A `WebCmsObject` can be any object, as long as it has a unique `objectId`.
The `objectId` is a `String` value, can be manually assigned but should never change once set.
It should also be unique within a single data store.

The unique `objectId` is used for importing/exporting and synchronizing data.

== WebCmsAsset

The base class for an asset is `WebCmsAsset`.
Default implementations are `WebCmsPage`, `WebCmsArticle` and `WebCmsPublication`.

By default an asset has a concept of being published or not.

The repository for working with the abstract `WebCmsAsset` is `WebCmsAssetRepository`.

WebCmsAssets also have a sortIndex, which will initially be set to 1000. Should you create your own `WebCmsAsset` implementation, do note that if you use a `Builder` pattern, that you will need to provide the logic to set the sortIndex to 1000. (e.g. override the default value inside the builder.)

== Linking assets

A generic `WebCmsAssetLink` object is available to link a `WebCmsAsset` to any `WebCmsObject` with a specific `linkType` demarcation.
These links are mapped using `WebCmsAssetLink` and `WebCmsAssetLinkRepository`

== WebCmsTypeSpecifier

The base class for a type is `WebCmsTypeSpecifier`.
A type is a specification attribute for another `WebCmsObject` like `WebCmsAsset` or `WebCmsComponent`.

Types are simpler objects that have a unique `typeKey` and descriptive `name`.
The `typeKey` must always be unique within all instances of that type.
The `typeKey` is used heavily throughout code or imports for an easy - readable way of identifying a specific type.

Apart from the `typeKey`, a `WebCmsTypeSpecifier` has a collection of `attributes`.
These are simple key/value pairs of strings that can be used for configuration and behaviour.

== Linking types

A generic `WebCmsTypeSpecifierLink` object is available to link a `WebCmsTypeSpecifier` to any `WebCmsObject` with a specific `linkType` demarcation.
These links are mapped using the `WebCmsTypeSpecifierLink` and `WebCmsTypeSpecifierLinkRepository`.
