= Publication model

WebCmsModule contains a default publication model for articles.
An article can typically be pretty much any type of content, but usually it is something like a piece of news or a blog article.

* An article is of a specific article type and belongs to a single publication.
* A publication is of a specific publication type.
* The publication type determines the different article types any publication of that publication type can have.

.Example model

* Publication type _blog_ would represent a collection of blog articles
** Article types _blog_ and _status-update_ would be linked to the publication type
* Publication _John's blog_ would be a single instance of the _blog_ publication type
* _Leaving on holiday today!_ would be an article of type _status-update_ in _John's blog_

.Default model

Out of the box, WebCmsModule configures the following data:

* publication types: *news*, *blogs*
* article types: *news*, *blog*
* template pages: */blog/****, ***/news/**

* publications:
** *news* with article type *news* and template page */news/**
** *blogs* with article type *blog* and template page */blog/**

== Domain implementation

=== Asset implementation

=== WebCmsArticle
Represents a single article.
`WebCmsArticle` is an implementation of a publishable `WebCmsAsset`.

The properties `title`, `subTitle` and `description` are metadata properties of an article.
The bulk of the article content is represented as a collection of components and can be configured on application level.

Properties `articleType` and `publication` refer to the `WebCmsArticleType` and `WebCmsPublication` of the article respectively.

See _<<publication-configuring-publication-model>>_ for an example component configuration.

An article is considered an asset with an endpoint URL.
When saving an article, a URL will always be created combining the title of the article with the canonical path of the publication template page.

=== WebCmsArticleType
Represents the specific type of an article.
`WebCmsArticleType` is an implementation of `WebCmsTypeSpecifier`.
The article type is used to determine the components that should be added to an article of that type.

The default components are the members of a container linked to the article type and will be cloned to every article created.
The name of the default component container is *contentTemplate*, but the name can be configured by setting the *contentTemplate* attribute on the `WebCmsArticleType`.
An article type can also use the component container from another article type.
The article type to reuse the component container from can be configured by setting the *parent* attribute to the `typeKey` of the other article type.

An article is always linked to a single article type.

See _<<publication-configuring-publication-model>>_ for a full example.

=== WebCmsPublication
Represents a named collection of articles.
`WebCmsPublication` is an implementation of a publishable `WebCmsAsset`.
Property `publicationType` refers to the `WebCmsPublicationType` of the publication.

Property `articleTemplatePage` links to a `WebCmsPage` that represents the template layout of the article.
When saving an article, the `canonicalPath` of the template page will be used as pattern (usually prefix) for the article URL.
The template page model will also be loaded automatically when rendering an article, see _<<publication-article-web-model>>_ for more information.

An article is always linked to a single publication.

=== WebCmsPublicationType
Represents the specific type of a publication.
`WebCmsPublicationType` is an implementation of `WebCmsTypeSpecifier`.
The publication type defines the different article types that are allowed in a publication of that type.

=== Services and repositories
The following repositories are available for managing the publication related domain model:

* `WebCmsPublicationTypeRepository`
* `WebCmsPublicationRepository`
* `WebCmsArticleTypeRepository`
* `WebCmsArticleRepository`

NOTE: If you want to change the strategy for default components, see the `WebCmsDefaultComponentsService`.

== Administrative UI
The default configuration allows managing publications and articles from the administration UI.
Both article type and publication type are assumed to be installed using code.

Enabling/disabling managing of article type or publication type can be done by modifying the EntityModule configuration of `WebCmsArticleType` and `WebCmsPublicationType`.

[[publication-article-web-model]]
== Web infrastructure
Any `WebCmsArticle` will automatically create a `WebCmsAssetEndpoint` with generated URL values.

=== Default article controller model
When requesting an article endpoint a default model will be rendered:

* the template rendered will be determined by the `WebCmsPage` that is the article template of the `WebCmsPublication` the article belongs to
* the components attached to the template page will be available as *page* scope
* the components attached to the article will be available as *article* scope, *article* is also the default scope
* the following model attributes will be registered:
** _article_: `WebCmsArticle` being rendered
** _asset_: `WebCmsArticle` being rendered (alias for _article_)
** _publication_: `WebCmsPublication` the article belongs to
** _page_: `WebCmsPage` that is the template page for that publication

The default article model is loaded by the `WebCmsArticleModelLoader` bean.

=== Custom article mapping
You can create your own article handler by using `@WebCmsArticleMapping` annotation.
The `@WebCmsArticleMapping` annotation can be combined with other `@RequestMapping` annotations to create a specific match.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
@WebCmsArticleMapping(publicationType = "news") // <1>
public void extendNewsArticleModel( WebCmsArticle article, Model model ) {
    model.addAttribute( "extraData", ... );
}

@GetMapping // <2>
@WebCmsArticleMapping(publicationType = "news", articleType = "breaking-news") // <2>
@IgnoreEndpointModel // <3>
public String renderBreakingNews( WebCmsArticle article, Model model ) {
    model.addAttribute( "article", article );
    return "th/my-app/breaking-news";
}
----

<1> Handler method that will be used for any article in a publication of type _news_, provided there is not a more specific handler (see next).
 The default article model will still be loaded, this handler only adds a model attribute.
 This handler method could optionally return a view, but since it does not, the view being rendered is still determined by the default model.

<2> Handler method for an article of type _breaking-news_ inside a _news_ publication, provided the article is requested using the HTTP _GET_ method.

<3> The `@IgnoreEndpointModel` annotation suppresses the default article model from being loaded.
 The handler method should fully initialize the model required as well as return the view that should be rendered.

[#importing]
=== Importing data
Most domain data of the publication model can be imported using YAML.
See _<<publication-configuring-publication-model>>_ for a full example.

[[publication-configuring-publication-model]]
==== Configuring your own publication model
This chapter describes a full example of defining a custom publication model.

We create an article type *Job* which represents a particular job offering.
A publication type *Jobs* can only contain *Job* articles.
And our publications *IT Jobs* and *Marketing Jobs* are example collections of different job offerings.

All required configuration is shown using the YAML data structures:

===== Defining the article type
We create a Job article type that specifies the different content fields any Job article should have.

[source,yaml]
----
types:
  article: // <1>
    job: // <2>
      name: Job // <3>
      wcm:components: // <4>
        content:
          title: Job fields
          componentType: container
          wcm:components:  // <5>
            company:
              title: Company
              componentType: text-field
              sortIndex: 0
            description:
              title: Job description
              componentType: rich-text
              content: <h1>@@title@@</h1>  // <6>
              sortIndex: 1
            salary:
              title: Salary package
              componentType: rich-text
              sortIndex: 2
----

<1> YAML data path _types/article_ specifies the block defines a `WebCmsArticleType`
<2> The type key of this `WebCmsArticleType` is *job*, and should be unique within article types.
In a list YAML structure, this value would be specified using the `typeKey` attribute instead.
For a `WebCmsTypeSpecifier` the type key also determines the unique object id that will be generated, in this case this would be *wcm:type:article:job*.
<3> Descriptive name of the article type.
<4> Represents the components directly linked to the `WebCmsArticleType`.
In this case the component with name *content* and title *Job fields*.
The *content* component represents the content template for a new article of that type.
This means that when a new article is created, the *content* component will be cloned and attached directly to the new article.
<5> Represents the collection of components that make up the members of the *content* component.
These are the actual content fields of a job article.
These fields will be directly editable in the administration UI and the `sortIndex` determines both rendering and editing order.
<6> Special markers _@@title@@_, _@@subTitle@@_ and _@@description@@_ can be used to represent article properties.
When creating a new article these markers will be replaced by the actual property value of the newly created article.

===== Defining the publication type
We create a Jobs publication type that can only hold articles with our Job article type.

[source,yaml]
----
types:
  publication: // <1>
    jobs: // <2>
      name: Jobs
      wcm:types: // <3>
        - linkType: article // <4>
          typeSpecifier: wcm:type:article:job  // <5>
----

<1> YAML data path _types/publication_ specifies the block defines a `WebCmsPublicationType`
<2> The type key of this `WebCmsPublicationType`, unique within publication types.
In a list YAML structure, this value would be specified using the `typeKey` attribute instead.
<3> The _wcm:types_ attribute defines a list of other `WebCmsTypeSpecifier` instances linked to the current entity being imported.
<4> We create an _article_ link type.
The link type can be any string value, but in case of a `WebCmsPublicationType` the article link type is used to refer to the `WebCmsArticleType` instances that are allowed in a publication of that `WebCmsPublicationType`.
<5> The unique object id of the `WebCmsArticleType` that is attached to this publication type.
Because a `WebCmsTypeSpecifierLink` can hold a reference to any `WebCmsTypeSpecifier`, we must use the globally unique object id.

===== Creating the publications
We create two publications with our Jobs types.
Both publications use the same article template page for rendering the article.

[source,yaml]
----
assets:
  page: // <1>
    - objectId: "wcm:asset:page:jobs-detail" // <2>
      canonicalPath: /jobs/*
      title: Job detail page
      pageType: template // <3>

  publication: // <4>
    it-jobs: // <5>
      name: IT Jobs
      publicationType: jobs // <6>
      published: true <7>
      articleTemplatePage: /jobs/* // <8>
    marketing-jobs:
      name: Marketing Jobs
      publicationType: jobs
      published: true
      articleTemplatePage: "wcm:asset:page:jobs-detail" // <8>
----

<1> YAML data path _assets/page_ specifies the block defines a `WebCmsPage`.
In this case we create the article template page that we'll refer to.
<2> Though not strictly required we manually define a unique object id for the page.
If omitted, the `canonicalPath` would serve as a unique identifier for referring to our page.
<3> Because our page serves as a template but it is not accessible by itself, we define it as a _template_ page type.
A template page will not get an endpoint or url created.
<4> YAML data path _assets/publication_ specifies the block defines a `WebCmsPublication`.
In this case we create our _IT Jobs_ and _Marketing Jobs_ publications.
<5> The publication key of this `WebCmsPublication`, unique within publications.
In a list YAML structure, this value would be specified using the `publicationKey` attribute instead.
We can use the `publicationKey` to refer to our publication in both code (eg. `@WebCmsArticleMapping`) and other YAML structures.
<6> We refer to our newly created _jobs_ publication type by using the publication `typeKey` value.
<7> We set our publication as published.
This ensures that all individually published articles of the publication will be actually available.
If a publication is not published (offline), none of its articles will be published.
<8> We link our publications to the template page we defined previously.
We can use either the `objectId` or the `canonicalPath` to refer to the `WebCmsPage`.

===== Adding a sample job to our IT Jobs publication

[source,yaml]
----
assets:
 article: // <1>
  - title: "IT Manager EMEA @ Foreach" // <2>
    objectId: "wcm:asset:article:job-it-manager-emea" // <3>
    publication: it-jobs // <4>
    articleType: job // <4>
    description: Supposed to be online until August 2017  // <2>
    published: true // <5>
    wcm:components: // <6>
      content:
        wcm:components:
          company:
            content: Foreach
          description:
            content: A really cool job at a really great company.
          salary:
            content: Remuneration package discussable.
----

<1> YAML data path _assets/article_ specifies the block defines a `WebCmsArticle`.
<2> We set some direct properties of the `WebCmsArticle`: `title` and `description`.
Note that these are different than the content components, which could have the same name (eg. description).
<3> We manually provide a unique `objectId` to our article.
This is the only identifier for an article and is required if we ever want to update the article through data imports.
<4> We create an article in our IT Jobs publication, and give it the job article type.
Note that even if we were to specify a different article type, the article would still be imported.
There is no hard validation during imports that only article types allowed for a publication can be imported.
<5> We publish the article upon creation.
This makes the article available online using a URL generated based on the article title and the article template page.
In our example, the generated url for the article would be _/jobs/it-manager-emea-foreach_
<6> We update the different content fields.
As each field is a member of the linked *content* component, this is the same as updating individual components.
