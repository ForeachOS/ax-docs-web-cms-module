=== Default component types

WebCmsModule contains a number of default component types, backed by a set of default `WebCmsComponentModel` implementations.
You can easily define your own component types by extending one of these base types, see the chapter <<components-defining-component-types,Defining component types>>.

The following component types are added with the default data:

[cols="1,4,1,1",options="header"]
|===

| Type key
| Description
| Base type ^1^
| WebCmsComponentModel

| proxy
| A proxy for another component that will be rendered instead.
| proxy
| `ProxyWebCmsComponentModel`

| placeholder
| Represents a placeholder for content provided by code or templates.
| placeholder
| `PlaceholderWebCmsComponentModel`

| container
| Container of multiple ordered components. The user can add or remove child components to the container.
| container
| `ContainerWebCmsComponentModel`

| fixed-container
| Container of a fixed set of components. The user can not add or remove child components to the container.
| fixed-container
| `ContainerWebCmsComponentModel`

| text-field
| A single line of plain text.
| plain-text
| `TextWebCmsComponentModel`

| plain-text
| Plain text component.
| plain-text
| `TextWebCmsComponentModel`

| rich-text
| Rich text component - supporting HTML markup and default assets if enabled by other modules.
| rich-text
| `TextWebCmsComponentModel`

| html
| A snippet of HTML.
| markup
| `TextWebCmsComponentModel`

| image
| Represents a `WebCmsImage` asset.
| image
| `ImageWebCmsComponentModel`

|===

^1^ The _Base type_ is the value of the *type* attribute on the `WebCmsComponentType`.  Every component type must have a unique type key, but several component types can have the same base type.

See `WebCmsComponentUtils` for some utility functions when working with components and component types.

==== WebCmsComponentModel implementations

All component models must extend `WebCmsComponentModel`.
A number of default implementations is provided by the WebCmsModule.
It is usually the `WebCmsComponentType` base type (_type_ attribute) that will determine the `WebCmsComponentModel` that gets instantiated.

===== TextWebCmsComponentModel
Represents a text component that can be either plain text, rich text or markup.
In all cases an optional profile is supported that can indicate the sub-types of content that are supported.

A `TextWebCmsComponentModel` is a large body of text (the `content` property) that should be escaped or not upon rendering.
The other properties are mostly relevant for the administrative user interface.

`TextWebCmsComponentModel` content can contain <<components-content-markers,content markers>>.

.Base types
The following base types will create a `TextWebCmsComponentModel`:

* _plain-text_: will escape its content when rendering
* _rich-text_: unescaped content with a RTE in the administration UI
* _markup_: unescaped content with a HTML editor in the administration UI

.Component type attributes
`TextWebCmsComponentModel` implementations check extra `WebCmsComponentType` attributes to map their properties.

[options=header,cols="1,4"]
|===

|Attribute
|Description

|_multiLine_
|If set to false, the component will behave as a single line of text.
In all other cases it will behave as a multi-line text component.

|_rows_
|Size indicator: number of rows the component should have by default.
Only applicable in case of a multi-line component.

|_profile_
|Optionally specify an additional text profile this component should use.
The text profile can for example be used to determine settings of the rich text editor.

|===

===== ContainerWebCmsComponentModel
A `ContainerWebCmsComponentModel` represents an ordered collection of other components (the container members).
By default a container simply renders its individual members in order.

.Markup containers
Containers can optionally also support markup (determined by the _supportsMarkup_ attribute on the actual `WebCmsComponentType`).
If markup is set, it represents the rendering template for the container and members should be rendered using <<components-content-markers,content markers>>.

Within container markup, component content markers can use the _container_ scope to reference a member of the container itself.

.Base types
The following base types will create a `ContainerWebCmsComponentModel`:

* _container_: allows dynamic addition/removal of members
* _fixed-container_: holds a fixed set of members (useful as a base type for custom components)

.Component type attributes
`ContainerWebCmsComponentModel` implementations check extra `WebCmsComponentType` attributes to map their properties.

[options=header,cols="1,4"]
|===

|Attribute
|Description

|_supportsMarkup_
|If set to *true* then markup on the container will be used for rendering if there is markup set.

|===

===== PlaceholderWebCmsComponentModel
A `PlaceholderWebCmsComponentModel` has only a single relevant property: the name of the placeholder whose content should be rendered.
By default if no placeholder content is available, this component will render an empty string.

Base type: _placeholder_

===== ProxyWebCmsComponentModel
A `ProxyWebCmsComponentModel` holds a reference to another component (the proxy target) and renders that component instead.
Use a `ProxyWebCmsComponentModel` if you want to add an already existing component as a member of a container.

Base type: _proxy_

===== ImageWebCmsComponentModel
An `ImageWebCmsComponentModel` holds a reference to a `WebCmsImage` asset.
Default rendering of an `ImageWebCmsComponentModel` is not very useful and developers should provide their own rendering by either updating the `WebCmsComponentType` with a custom _template_ or by providing the rendering infrastructure (see <<components-thymeleaf-rendering,Thymeleaf rendering>>).

NOTE: For the `ImageWebCmsComponentModel` to function, a valid `WebCmsImageConnector`  bean should be present.  See the chapter <<images-image-model,Image model>> for more information.
