[[components-overview]]
== Web component model
Web CMS Components are the building block of the pages that are displayed for the end user. Support is provided for a user friendly way of manipulating the content of those components via the back end.

=== WebCmsComponentType

=== WebCmsComponent

`WebCmsComponent`

persisted entity

== WebCmsComponentModel
`WebCmsComponentModelService` and `WebCmsComponentModel`
`WebCmsComponentType`

The persisted entity is implemented by `WebCmsComponent`, but usually you will want to work with the `WebCmsComponentModel`.
The latter represents the entire strongly typed model ready for rendering, whereas the former only has the raw attributes.

== Activating component support
Any `WebCmsObject` - this includes all assets and components themselves - can have web components linked to it.
Enabling components for WebCmsObject implementations: wire WebCmsObjectComponentViewsConfiguration: registerComponentsAssociation

== Rendering components

=== Creating shared web components
.Shared web components
[options="header", cols="2,1,1,3,1"]
|================
|Name|Type|Mandatory|Description|Default Value
|Component Type|Component Type|Yes|Type of the component, selectable from the list of predefined component types.|None
|Title|String|Yes|The name of the component. Displayed in the admin section.|None
|Name|String|Yes|The unique identifier with which you can approach the component in your Thymeleaf template. Should be unique, and can be auto-generated based on Title|None
|================
=== Using components in your controllers
A `WebCmsComponentModelHierarchy` is attached to the `ApplicationContext` of the current request and allows components to be looked up in the various scopes. By default the `global` and `domain` scope are registered. Using the `WebCmsComponentModelHierarchy`, it is possible to register additional scopes, attach/replace/remove components to a scope and define aliases for a scope.

The `WebCmsComponentModelHierarchy` is used to retrieve components in the thymeleaf dialect and is used to search for components in various scopes.

Note: The `WebCmsComponentModelHiercharchy` is a request scoped bean, so it can simply be autowired. It should however not be wired inside a controller handler method as it has a parameterless constructor.

Example of registering a custom component to the `asset` scope:
[source, java]
----
@Controller
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class MyController {
  
  private final WebCmsComponentModelHierarchy componentModelHierarchy;
  
  @WebCmsArticleMapping(articleType="blog")
  public void myHandler(){
    WebCmsComponentModelSet componentModelSet = new WebCmsComponentModelSet();
    TextWebCmsComponentModel text = new TextWebCmsComponentModel();
    text.setContent("some text");
    text.setName("my-custom-component");
    componentModelSet.add(text);
    componentModelHierarchy.registerComponentsForScope(componentModelSet, "asset");
  }
}

== Importing components

=== Single value importing
The `TextWebCmsComponentModel` and `ImageWebCmsComponentModel` support updating existing components using a single attribute value.

This is the same as assigning the following property:

[options="header", cols="2,1"]
|================
|Component type |Property
|`TextWebCmsComponentModel`| _content_
|`ImageWebCmsComponentModel`| _image_
|================

.Example: the following 2 import blocks would be equivalent
[source,yaml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
assets:
  article:
    - title: My article
      wcm:components:
        body:
          content: Update the article body text
----
[source,yaml,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes,attributes"]
----
assets:
  article:
    - title: My article
      wcm:components:
        body: Update the article body text
----
