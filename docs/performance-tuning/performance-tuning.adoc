= Performance tuning

This chapter describes some recommended settings for improving the overall performance of WebCmsModule.

== URL resolving

The mapping infrastructure \(eg. `@WebCmsPageMapping`\) has as a drawback that any request will be matched against all registered `WebCmsUrl` entries.  It is strongly advised to configure the _WebCmsUrlCache_ to cache these lookups, as well as to limit the request paths for lookup if you can do so.

By default all requests will be matched against the `WebCmsUrl` collection.  You can control which requests should be matched by specifying one ore more ANT path patterns in the relevant settings.

=== URL resolve path properties

| Property | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| webCmsModule.urls.included-path-patterns | Paths to be included for `WebCmsUrl` mapping.  If empty, all non-excluded paths will be considered.  If not empty, only requests matching one of these paths will be mapped to a possible `WebCmsUrl`. |
| webCmsModule.urls.excluded-path-patterns | Paths to always be excluded from `WebCmsUrl` mapping.  If empty, only included paths will be considered.  If not empty, requests matching these patterns will be excluded, even if they match the included patterns. |

> **WARNING**
>
> If URL resolving is disabled for a particular path, `@WebCmsEndpointMapping` handler methods that use a `WebCmsUrl` with that path will never match.  Disable URL resolving only if you are sure you will handle all requests for these paths manually.

== Caching

WebCmsModule uses some specific caches to improve performance.  It is recommended to configure these caches in any production application.

=== WebCmsModule custom caches

| Cache name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| WebCmsUrlCache | Maps request paths to matching `WebCmsUrl` instances.  Only caches the url id, requires 2nd level cache enabled for optimal performance gain. |
| WebCmsMenuCache | Caches the menu structure that should be generated from corresponding `WebCmsMenu` items.  Prefer to cache these for a long time if possible. |
| WebCmsDomainCache | Relevant in a multi-domain setup.  Caches domains and their metadata.  Domain lookups happen on pratically every request so this cache is very important.  Domain settings are usually quite static, so caching for a very long time is often feasible. |

=== Hibernate level 2 cache

To improve overall performance of the domain model, configuring Hibernate level 2 cache is also strongly advised.

The cache names for the Hibernate level 2 cache are always fully qualified class names.  The prefix **c.f.a.m.w.d** stands for **com.foreach.across.modules.webcms.domain**.

| Cache name | Hints |
| :--- | :--- |
| c.f.a.m.w.d.url.WebCmsUrl | Holds WebCmsUrl entity data.  The size of your WebCmsUrl cache should be a multiple of your WebCmsEndpoint cache and a minimum of one-to-one, as usually there are multiple urls per endpoint. |
| c.f.a.m.w.d.endpoint.WebCmsEndpoint | References WebCmsRemoteEndpoint and WebCmsAssetEndpoint.  Size this cache according to the number of redirects or assets you expect to be frequently accessed.  Depending on your application setup a good guideline is at least the size of your `WebCmsAsset` cache.  If you use a lot of redirects, you should provide some additional space. |
| c.f.a.m.w.d.type.WebCmsTypeSpecifier | The items in the `WebCmsTypeSpecifier` cache can usually be cached for a long time, because they do not change often. |
| c.f.a.m.w.d.asset.WebCmsAsset | The size and duration of your `WebCmsAsset` cache depend on how you use them. If you do not change existing assets often, you should opt for a longer duration. |
| c.f.a.m.w.d.domain.WebCmsDomain | The items in your `WebCmsDomain` cache are usually very static and are accessed frequently.  It's usually best to cache these for a very long time. |
