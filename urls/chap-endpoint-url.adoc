[[endpoint-url]]
= Endpoints and URLs
{module-name} provides a basic a basic model for mapping an endpoint on a website.
An endpoint has one or more URLs pointing to it.
The endpoint data determines the handler method that will be executed on the application end.

== WebCmsEndpoint
A `WebCmsEndpoint` represents a single endpoint, and has a `urls` property which is the collection of `WebCmsUrl` instances that point to the endpoint.

{module-name} provides two endpoint implementations:

* `WebCmsAssetEndpoint` maps a single asset (by default only `WebCmsPage` or `WebCmsArticle`)
* `WebCmsRemoteEndpoint` maps :link:content/chap-redirects.html[redirects to a target URL]

=== Primary URL
An endpoint can have a single *primary URL*.
The primary URL is considered to be the primary URL identifier for the endpoint.
If an endpoint has multiple redirecting URLs mapped, the target of the redirect should be the primary URL.

[[WebCmsUrl-overview]]
== WebCmsUrl
`WebCmsUrl` represents a single URL targeting a specific endpoint with a HTTP-status code.
A `WebCmsUrl` must be coupled with an `WebCmsEndpoint`.

=== Properties of an URL

[options="header", cols="2,1,1,3,1"]
|================
|Name|Type|Mandatory|Description|Default Value
|Path|String|Yes|The relative path of the URL|None
|Http Status|Http Status|The status that will be thrown.
See the next table for more information.|None
|Is Primary URL|Boolean|Is this the primary URL? Must be unique per endpoint|None
|================

=== Default HTTP Status codes

[options="header", cols="1,1,2"]
|================
|Status|Corresponds With|Result
|Moved Permanently|301|Redirects to the primary URL
|Moved Temporarily|302|Redirects to the primary URL
|Not Found|404|Redirects to the 404 page.
|OK|200|Done
|================

== Services/repositories
The primary API for working with URLs in application code is the `WebCmsEndpointService`.

If you want to manually manage endpoints on a lower level, the following repositories are available:

* `WebCmsEndpointRepository`
* `WebCmsAssetEndpointRepository`
* `WebCmsRemoteEndpointRepository`

== Mapping infrastructure
{module-name} configures default mapping and model loading for its default endpoints:

* a `WebCmsAssetEndpoint` accessed with a `WebCmsUrl` that has a redirection status code will result in a redirect to the primary URL of that endpoint
* a `WebCmsAssetEndpoint` accessed with a `WebCmsUrl` with a non redirection status code, will load the default endpoint model and render a default template
* a `WebCmsRemoteEndpoint` accessed will redirect to the destination URL using the status code of the mapped `WebCmsUrl`

In all cases the status code of the response will be the status code of the `WebCmsUrl` the request is mapped to.

A `WebCmsEndpoint` is resolved once per request, when the `DispatcherServlet` determines the handler method to execute.
The resolved endpoint is stored on the request-scoped `WebCmsEndpointContext` bean and can be used throughout code.

NOTE: The `WebCmsEndpoint` as well as the `WebCmsUrl` of a request can be used as handler method arguments.

=== Mapping handler methods
You can easily create your own handler methods for specific endpoints using the `@WebCmsEndpointMapping` annotation. This allows you to map on the `WebCmsEndpoint` implementation, as well as status codes of the `WebCmsUrl` the request should be mapped to.

_Example endpoint handler method_

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Controller
public class SillyRemoteEndpointController
{
  @ResponseBody
  @WebCmsEndpointMapping(value = WebCmsRemoteEndpoint.class, status = HttpStatus.I_AM_A_TEAPOT)
  public String renderTargetForTeapots( WebCmsRemoteEndpoint endpoint ) {
    return endpoint.getTargetUrl();
  }
}
----

NOTE: For `WebCmsPage` and `WebCmsArticle` it is easier to use the specialized annotations `@WebCmsPageMapping` and `@WebCmsArticleMapping` respectively.

=== Default model loading
When a `WebCmsEndpoint` is loaded, {module-name} will attempt to load a default model for the request.
The default implementations will add model attributes, set a default template or load asset components.
See the `WebCmsEndpointModelLoader` interface for adding your own default model loaders for endpoints.

Default model loading will always be done, regardless of the actual handler method invoked.
If you want to specifically suppress the default model, you should annotate your handler method with `@IgnoreEndpointModel`.

=== Access validation
Whenever a `WebCmsEndpoint` is requested, the endpoint will be matched against all available `WebCmsEndpointAccessValidator` beans to see if the endpoint is allowed.
Default implementations will for example only allow access to assets that are published, unless the request happens in preview mode.

See the `WebCmsEndpointAccessValidator` source code for implementing your own validation mechanisms.

== Enabling URLs for an asset
By default URL mappings are only enabled for `WebCmsPage` and `WebCmsArticle` assets.
This means as soon a `WebCmsPage` or `WebCmsArticle` is created, a single `WebCmsAssetEndpoint` linked to the asset will be created as well.

If you want to enable URL management for other `WebCmsAsset` implementations, you can do so using the `WebCmsAssetUrlConfiguration`.
Once enabled, URLs tab will be available for that asset in the administration UI.

_Manually enabling URLs for an asset_

[source,java,indent=0]
----
@Autowired
void enableUrls( WebCmsAssetUrlConfiguration urlConfiguration ) {
    urlConfiguration.enable( WebCmsPublication.class );
}
----

Enabling URLs will ensure a `WebCmsAssetEndpoint` will always be available for that asset.
It will however not create any `WebCmsUrl` when saving the asset, application specific code should take care of that. +
 +
Likewise actual rendering of the asset might require custom implementations as well.
